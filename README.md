# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to assist V. Isualize, the CEO, and Omar, the head of data, to improve access to ride-sharing services. PyBer is a Python based ride-sharing app company that serves three city types: Rural, Urban and Suburban. A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type was generated by performing an exploratory analysis on data with Python. Additionally, a multiple-line chart was created using Matplotlib to showcase the relationship between total fares and type of city.

This analysis can be used to inform discussion and assist the CEO and management to determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results

### Datasets and Files

The PyBer analysis is based on the following datasets: 
* City Data: [city_data](Resources/city_data.csv)
* Ride Data: [ride_data](Resources/ride_data.csv)

The PyBer analysis is available here: [PyBer_Challenge](PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)

### Software and Application

The software and web-based application used for this analysis are:

* Python 3.7.11 (using PythonData environment and Pandas Library)
* Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6
* Matplotlib 

### Outcomes 
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 
Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
